# Landing-Page

Hello! Greetings from me. I am currently working on a landing page as part of my submission for The Odin Project. While learning web development through this excellent resource, I'm applying the skills I've gained to build a clean and functional landing page. Itâ€™s an exciting opportunity to showcase my progress and put my newly acquired knowledge into practice.
